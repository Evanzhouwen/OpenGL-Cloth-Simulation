# OpenGL-Cloth-Simulation
A C++ OpenGL cloth simulation using verlet integration.

This project models and displays a simulation of a cloth attached to a hanger, as if it were curtains in front of a window. The goal of the project was to build our understanding of OpenGL and to ultimately to show off what we've learned in our Graphics course at Gonzaga University. The project works by representing vertices as "masses" and then treating each mass as if it were connected to its neighbors by a spring.

## Setup
With [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/) installed, you should be able to open the `.cbp` file and open the project.
